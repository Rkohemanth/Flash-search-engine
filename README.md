1. Overview
This project provides a basic framework for a search engine. It includes a front-end interface where users can input queries, and a back-end system that processes these queries (currently without full functionality). The current system only supports basic search query handling, and more advanced search features are yet to be implemented.

2. Features
User Interface: Simple and clean design for entering search queries.
Back-end Integration: Front-end communicates with the back-end for query processing.
Search Query Handling: Input search queries can be processed by the server (though results are static for now).
3. Technologies Used
Front-end:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (Vanilla JS or libraries)
Back-end:
Node.js (or any other server-side technology used)
Express.js (for API handling)
Other:
JSON (for data exchange)
4. Setup and Installation
To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:
